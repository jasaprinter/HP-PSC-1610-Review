Consumers looking to purchase a printer for use with their home computer or even for a small business may find that the HP PSC 1610 is an ideal choice. This thermal inkjet printer offers speeds that are close to those of a laser printer along with high quality prints. In addition, the HP PSC 1610 all-in-one printer has the capability to scan documents and make color or black and white copies.

HP has a long history of providing quality computers and peripherals. This well known company will not disappoint consumers with this printer. The HP 1610 has been available for over five years now and some of the complaints from the early versions of the installation software have been repaired, making this a reliable all in one printer for use in the home.

The 1610 offers prints using thermal inkjet printing that are up to 1200 dpi in the monochromatic mode and 4800×1200 in color. When set in the draft printing mode, black prints are produced at the rate of 23 ppm while color prints are prepared at 18 ppm. Copies are a little slower, being produced in black at 15 cpm or color at 10 cpm. The scanning feature of this device results in 48-bit color scans at a 1200×4800 dpi resolution. It is possible for owners to make photo prints directly from the memory card of their camera without having to use a computer to download the prints.

The HP PSC 1610 does not offer a duplex printing mode. Operators needing two sided prints or copies will find that they must re-feed the paper through the printer a second time in the correct orientation in order to create two sided documents.

Connectivity to the computer is made through a USB or USB host. This type of connectivity is now standard with most printers designed for home use. If you need another type of connectivity to the printer, users will probably need to look at printers designed for use in small workgroups or businesses.
